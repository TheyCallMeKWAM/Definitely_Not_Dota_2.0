[h1]1.91 - Quality of Life Patch [/h1]

[h1]News:[/h1]

-Rename: The game has been renamed to Definitely Not Dota 2.0 
This is because of 2 differant reasons
1: It searches a lot better, so it is easier to find for new players
2: The name I originally made was just a funny run on joke!
If you think it should be reverted to "Definitely Not A Remake of Definitely Not Dota" let me know on the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1634848002steam] workshop page![/url]

[h1]Gamemode Changes[/h1]
-		Shops: Updated to have all the items that 7.21 released.
-		Money: Made the automatic gold gain larger, to make the game a faster pace
-		Exp: Made the automatic exp gain larger, to make the game a faster pace
-		Workshop Imaage: Changed to reflect the name change.
-		Removed the title from the loading screen, beacuse it was out of place.

[h1]What's Next:[/h1]
-		I'm still looking for people to help me with some cool panorama stuff, add me on steam if you can!
-		2 New heroes are in the works
-		Working on my first ever custom map!!! (It will probably be really poop(cant swear on steam :)]
-		Further development on growing the community!!!!
-		Be sure to tell you friends to come play and give this game a try (more fun with more people)

[h1]FAQ:[/h1]
Q: Why did you change the exp and gold gain?
A: It has only been changed outside of the main circle, this is beacuse the game can be very one sided if someone is overpowered in the centre. This allows players to still be in the game even if they can't make it to the centre

Q: Does the centre still provide a bonus?
A: Yes it still provided a bonus ontop of the changes

Q: Why is dagon banned?
A: F Dagon, NEXT QUESTION
AP2: It is banned in regular overthrow.
